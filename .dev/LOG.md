# adic work log

## 2026-08-09 (later) — dyadic machine lands

- **AIP-2 accepted**: the dyadic machine D, D_n per grade
  (`aips/accepted/0002-dyadic-machine-v0.md`). All seven taste calls
  decided (Mathijs; leaf-order delegated to Claude): bits at leaves,
  k heads fixed per program with no inter-head observation,
  internal-node rest allowed, stuck semantics, no swap in v0,
  two-layer leaf-order convention (tree-order numbering for
  metatheory, little-endian data layout). Designed-for-proof
  addendum (§5) added same day: monoid-action presentation,
  recursive memory T(n+1)=T(n)×T(n), cost via tree metric,
  closed-form totals. Odometer insight recorded at theorem 1:
  streaming = adding-machine fact, kinship with Vershik.
- Name scan done (H-machine rejected, adic machine soft-rejected);
  "adic" stays the language/discipline name.
- New draft in inbox: `aips/draft/roadmap.md` — berries + sequencing;
  asks ratification of Lean-first (Lean def doubles as v0 simulator).
- Standing grant recorded in CLAUDE.md: commit+push to main for
  AIP/docs/LOG work without asking. Gitsitter-amend pitfall recorded
  there too.
- **Open with Mathijs**: roadmap draft (ratify Lean-first + machine
  paper timing), `aips/draft/paper.md` (3 calls).
- **Open for agents**: once Lean-first is ratified — Lean toolchain
  into devenv, then mechanize D_n + theorems 1–2 per AIP-2 §5.

## 2026-08-09 — project born

- Founding conversation imported from claude.ai ("Dependently typed
  language over idealized computation models", 56 messages, indices
  sparse to [73]) → `docs/convo.md`; terra wrote `docs/convo-summary.md`.
- Process adopted from composix: AIPs (`aips/README.md`), `.dev/LOG.md`
  journal, `.dev/specs/`, track/worker conventions in `AGENTS.md` +
  `CLAUDE.md`.
- **AIP-1 accepted**: the language is called **adic** (repo moves
  `~/nextlang` → `~/adic`). Prototype language: Rust (Mathijs's call,
  same session).
- Drafts in inbox: `machine-v0` (the dyadic machine — spec,
  prior work, theorem targets, 6 taste calls), `paper` (organizing
  thesis-length artifact, Typst, claims ledger).
- devenv (rust + typst + cargo-watch + jq) built green.
- Rename executed (`~/adic`); founding commit pushed to the public
  repo `github.com/mathijshenquet/adic` (Mathijs's call, same
  session). `docs/convo.json` checked before publishing: first name +
  uuids only, no e-mail.
- Session restarts in `~/adic` after this entry; next session starts
  at the CLAUDE.md session ritual (this LOG's top entry).
- **Open with Mathijs**: read `aips/draft/machine-v0.md` (6 taste
  calls) and `aips/draft/paper.md` (3); standing commit/push/merge
  grants for this repo (this push was a one-off instruction).
- **Open for agents**: nothing until machine-v0 lands (then: simulator
  track).
